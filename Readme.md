# About Induction Motor Design Tool

## Disclaimer 
**This tool is intended to replace iterative calculations in the design of asynchronous motors.** 
**This tool is curently in development and may not work**

## Working Principles

At the input, enter the desired parameters that the motor should have, such as:

- Voltage
- Frequency
- Winding Connection
- Number of Poles
- Effieciency
- Power Factor
- Power or Torque
- Material of the Core
- Material of the Coils
- Types of Stator and Rotor Slots
- Desired Starting Current
- Desired Starting Toruqe
- Desired Maximum Torque

The **GUI** is represented in the next picture.

The starting values of the **magnetic fluxes**, **dimensions of the slots** and other parameters which must be declared by the designer are generated by the program. A matrix is generated with the all posible combinations of this parameters. After this parameters are generated, the program start calculating the other parameters of the motor. When all parameters are calculated, the program check if the calculated parameters satisfy the conditions which are given by the designer. If are satisfied, the program writes the parameters values in *Parameters.csv*, found in *designed_motor_parameters* folder. Else the program pick another combination from the matrix and start the calcualion from begining.
