# About Induction Motor Design Tool

## Few Words About This Application 
**This tool is intended to replace iterative calculations in the design of asynchronous motors.** 
**This tool is currently in development and may not work**

## Working Principle

The starting values of the **magnetic fluxes**, **dimensions of the slots** and other parameters, which must be declared by the designer, are generated by the program. The matrix is generated with the all possible combinations of these parameters. After these parameters are generated, the program starts calculating the other parameters of the motor.
When all the parameters are calculated, the program checks if the calculated parameters satisfy the conditions which are given by the designer. If they are satisfied, the program writes the parameters values in *Parameters.csv*, found in *designed_motor_parameters* folder. Otherwise, the program picks another combination from the matrix and starts the calculation from the beginning.

## Application GUI

At the input, enter the desired parameters that the motor should have, such as:

Nominal Parameters:

- Voltage
- Frequency
- Winding Connection
- Number of Poles
- Efficiency
- Power Factor
- Power or Torque

Motor Materials:

- Material of the Core
- Material of the Coils

Slot Types:

- Stator Slot
- Rotor Slot

Ratios:

- Desired Starting Current
- Desired Starting Torque
- Desired Maximum Torque

After that, mark which condtition to be satisfied by the application.


The **GUI** is represented in the following figure.

By selecting **Browse**, choose where to save the designed parameters of the motor. By selecting **Results**, you can view the designed parameters of the motor.

## Results

The Results GUI is represented in the following figure.

![Results](Results.png)

In the **Results** window, on the left side, the plots of the mechanical and load characteristc are drawn. On the right side, the values of the nominal data, the conditions, winding type, slots type and material of the core are displayed. 

By clicking **Show pdf** or **Show csv**, a file opens with all written parameters of the designed motor.

If two **Results** windows are open and than by clicking on **Browse**, two different designed motors are choosen; by clicking on **Analyze Mechanical** or **Analyze Load**, the plots from the two different **Results** windows are drawn on a same new plot.

## Options

The Options GUI is represented in the following figure.

Here the maximum and minimum values of the generated parameters can be chagned. Also the value of the alowed magnetizing current can be changed if needed. In the accuracy field, the accuracy of the disared values for the condition can be changed. Higher accuracy value, more time needed for the calculation.
